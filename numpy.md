## Slice Notation

*2019-02-21*

```python
a[start:end] # items start through end-1
a[start:]    # items start through the rest of the array
a[:end]      # items from the beginning through end-1
a[:]         # a copy of the whole array
a[start:end:step] # start through not past end, by step
```

Note that **end-1** is the last element of the array.
